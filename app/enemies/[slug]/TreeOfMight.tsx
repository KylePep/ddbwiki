        <h2 className='font-semibold'>Act 1</h2>
        <p className='mb-3'>One night as Bulma, Krillin, Oolong and Gohan are out on a camping trip, an unknown cosmic object heading towards Earth, crash lands in the forest nearby, causing a fire. While Gohan and Krillin are successfully able to rescue the forest animals, including a small dragon named Icarus, and put out the blaze, the forest is still left in ruins. They decide to gather the Dragon Balls to ask Shenron to restore the forest to its original state. Later, the cosmic object that crashed and caused the forest fire earlier reveals itself to be a probe and scans the environment. The information is relayed to an unfriendly group of aliens under the leadership of a Saiyan. They determine that the planet {`Earth's`} soil is suitable for growing the Tree of Might, a plant that sucks all of the nutrients out of the planet on which it was planted and leaves it a desert, and so they head directly for Earth.</p>
        <p>Icarus, having not returned to the forest, follows Gohan back to his home much to {`Chi-Chi's`} fury who says that he {`can't`} keep it and demands he take it back to the mountains. Goku, however, shows Gohan a small cave nearby where Icarus can reside. The unknown band of aliens, having now arrived on Earth, plant the seed in the area which the probe had previously landed. The explosion they cause wrecks the new cruiser Yamcha and Puar are flying in. The seed soon grows quickly into a tree of monstrous size, laying waste to a large portion of the area within its vicinity.</p>

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>Act 2</h2>
        <p className='mb-3'>Back at {`Goku's`} house, Krillin, Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, Puar, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Master Roshi have all gathered for dinner with {`Goku's`} family. While Yamcha tells everyone about his wrecked cruiser, Goku is suddenly contacted by King Kai, who informs him of the Tree of Might and the danger it possesses. After Goku tells the others, he, along with Yamcha, Krillin, Tien and Chiaotzu, head out to destroy the tree. However, Chi-Chi forbids Gohan from going along with them. At the tree, the group use their energy attacks to try and destroy the tree, to no effect. Goku, sensing others nearby, is then confronted by the aliens, known as the Turles Crusher Corps., whilst their leader watches from inside the spaceship. Soon after the battles ensue with Tien and Chiaotzu facing off against twin brothers Rasin and Lakasei, Krillin taking on Amond and Yamcha taking on Cacao, though the Z Fighters struggle against their opponents. Goku ends up taking on both Daiz and Cacao simultaneously, blasting them away with a Double Kamehameha.</p>
        <p>During the ensuing battle, Chiaotzu is rescued by Gohan, who had just arrived after disobeying his mother, and demonstrates his incredible fighting skills by easily taking out Lakasei. He is then encountered by the {`aliens'`} leader, Turles, a low class Saiyan who bears a striking resemblance to Goku. Turles gives Gohan a choice to either join him or die. Gohan refuses to join Turles and is saved in time thanks to the arrival of Piccolo. However, Turles ambushes and blasts him from behind, having Gohan where he wants him. He notices {`Gohan's`} regrown tail and creates an artificial moon, forcibly turning Gohan into a Great Ape and then immediately afterwards destroys the moon so he himself would not transform too.</p>

        <h2 className='font-semibold'>Act 3</h2>
        <p className='mb-3'>Goku, seeing that Gohan is in trouble, goes to help him and attempts to reason with Gohan, but it is no use and soon Goku is almost crushed to death in {`Gohan's`} hand until Icarus arrives and calms Gohan down. But when Turles attacks Icarus, Gohan is angered and turns on Turles, who fires an attack at Gohan. Before the attack can make contact, Goku manages to cut his {`son's`} tail off to revert him to his normal state. Cradling a naked Gohan in his arms, Goku promises to defeat Turles. {`Turles'`} henchmen arrive, having defeated the other Z Fighters, then attack Goku, who uses the Kaio-ken to quickly kill them while Piccolo unsuccessfully fights Turles again. Goku and Turles then fight, with Goku having the upper hand until Turles pushes his power further by eating a fruit from the Tree of Might. With his newfound power, Turles dominates Goku and beats him to the point that he is no longer able to fight, even after using the Kaio-ken x10.</p>
        <p>With encouragement from the others, Goku begins gathering energy needed for the Spirit Bomb while the other injured Z Fighters, except a still-unconscious Gohan, try to buy Goku some time, though they are quickly defeated. Despite gaining energy from the people of Earth and launching the Spirit Bomb, Turles is able to counterattack with the Calamity Blaster, neutralizing {`Goku's`} attack. Due to the Tree of Might absorbing the {`Earth's`} energy, the Spirit Bomb lacked sufficient power, so Goku decides to take energy from inside the Tree of Might itself. Eventually successful in recreating the Spirit Bomb, Goku fires it at Turles, who tries to counter with his own ki wave. He is carried up the trunk of the Tree of Might and destroyed along with the Tree when the Spirit Bomb explodes, releasing the absorbed energy all over the planet and its living things. With the terror now over and Icarus revealed to still be alive, the Z Fighters enjoy their time on another camping trip while Piccolo meditates peacefully near a waterfall.</p>
